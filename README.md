# desvirtUI

A web-based GUI for desvirts topologycreator functionality. For more information on desvirt, look at the [desvirt project page](https://github.com/des-testbed/desvirt).
This application generates desvirt configuration files based on a drag-n-drop created topology. It adds links between nodes based on [Free Space Path Loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss) and adds the used parameters to the output config.

It's a Create React App. How to start a test server is documented in [the coresponding Readme](https://github.com/Chamaeleon-/TopologyCreatorUI/blob/master/desvirt-ui/README.md).
